I've analyzed your requirements document and identified the following components:

## Key Features
- User authentication system
- Product management
- Order processing
- Payment integration
- Reporting dashboard

## Technical Requirements
- React frontend with Tailwind CSS
- RESTful API design
- Database schema for users, products, and orders
- Security implementation

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the requirements?`;

To better support your project, I recommend gathering documentation and resources in the following categories:

## Technology Stack Documentation
- Frontend framework documentation
- Backend framework documentation
- Database documentation

## Industry Standards
- Security best practices
- Accessibility guidelines
- Performance benchmarks

## Example Projects
- Similar applications for reference
- Code samples

Please share any specific resources you'd like to add to the project knowledge base.`;

Based on analysis of your application, here are key recommendations:

## Frontend Optimizations
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy
- Optimize images with WebP format and lazy loading
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size
- Use memoization for expensive calculations

## Backend Optimizations
- Implement API response caching
- Optimize database queries
- Use connection pooling
- Consider serverless functions for scalability

## Network Optimizations
- Enable HTTP/2
- Implement content compression
- Use CDN for static assets
- Optimize API payload size

Would you like me to provide specific code examples for any of these optimizations?`;

## System Architecture
This application follows a modern web architecture with the following components:

### Frontend
- React with functional components and hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- State management with Context API and React Query

### Backend
- RESTful API design principles
- Authentication with JWT
- Data validation and sanitization

### Database
- Relational database schema
- Indexed queries for performance
- Data integrity constraints

## Deployment Architecture
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Containerized with Docker
- Cloud hosting with automatic scaling

## Security Considerations
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input sanitization
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting

Would you like me to expand on any specific section of this documentation?`;
