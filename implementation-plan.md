## Development Approach

### Code Quality Standards
- All code must be typed with TypeScript
- Unit test coverage should be at least 70%
- All components must be responsive and accessible
- Code must pass ESLint and Prettier checks
- Pull requests require code review before merging

### Collaboration Protocol
- Daily check-ins on progress and blockers
- Feature branches named by domain (e.g., `feature/product-listing`)
- Code reviews required for all pull requests
- Documentation updates required for all new features
- Regular end-to-end testing of integrated features

### Monitoring & Improvement
- Implement error tracking and monitoring
- Set up performance monitoring dashboards
- Create feedback collection mechanisms
- Plan for iterative improvements based on metrics and user feedback

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the platform while allowing for flexibility as requirements evolve. Each phase builds upon the previous one, focusing on delivering core value early while preparing for more advanced features in later stages.
