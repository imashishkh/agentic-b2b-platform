Putting It All Together

By modularizing each part of your platform into clearly defined components (header, search, product card, checkout step, etc.), you’ll create a flexible UI system. This approach allows:
	•	Reusability: The same product card component can be used in “Featured Products,” “Related Items,” or “Search Results.”
	•	Consistency: Shared styling and interaction patterns across the site.
	•	Scalability: Easy to add or modify features (e.g., adding a “Request a Quote” button only for B2B users).

Use a design system (e.g., Figma Components, React UI libraries, or a custom design system) to ensure these components are maintained centrally and updated consistently across your e-commerce app.
